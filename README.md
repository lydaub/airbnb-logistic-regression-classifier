# 🏠 Airbnb Logistic Regression Classifier

Machine Learning Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning

### 🔍 Overview

This project uses logistic regression to solve a classification problem based on Airbnb listings.
The purpose of the lab is to practice the Evaluation phase of the ML lifecycle, including:
- Model Training
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Precision/recall Analysis
- ROC & AUC Evaluation
- Feature Selection
- Model Persistence

The project is organized using a clear, repeatable ML workflow.

### 🎯 ML Problem Definition
- Type: Binary classification
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Goal: Predict whether a listing belongs to a given category (e.g., expensive vs not expensive)

  🧪 Methodology

1. Build DataFrame & Define Label
2. Train/Test Split
3. Train Baseline Logistic Regression
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search)
5. Evaluate Model Performance

For both models:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score
- Accuracy
